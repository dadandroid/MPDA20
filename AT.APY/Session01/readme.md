# MDPA20 - AT.APY 
## First Session

### K-means algorithm - Part 1

[MPDA20_AT-APY-01-kmeans.gh](https://github.com/dadandroid/MPDA20/blob/master/AT.APY/Session01/MPDA20_AT-APY-01-kmeans.gh) is the file from last class. 

### Exercise 01
1. Convert the 2D K-Means algorithm that we developed in class to 3D-Kmeans by using 3D Points and 3D Voronoi using the same logic.
2. You will have to test for point inclusion inside of Breps (Brep.IsPointInside) (look for that in [RhinoCommon](https://developer.rhino3d.com/api/RhinoCommon/html/N_Rhino.htm))
3. Bonus points if you use as sabe meaninful dataset of Ppoints, wheather it is 3d Points or data that you can clasify in three dimensions (X, Y, Z)
4. You must submit your .gh file to [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mVgtUDy_sFaDpY4U_36OEmcNLzg4xOlp?usp=sharing) **no later Wednesday 11th of March than 11:59pm** with format __MPDA20-ATAPY-EX01-Your_Name.gh__ 
5. We will review some of the excersies in the next class
